### My Data Science, Machine Learning, and NLP projects

#### Sentiment Analysis on Tweets
Sentiment analysis helps analyze the emotions behind tweets and other text data. This project uses **XLM-RoBERTa**, a multilingual transformer model, to classify tweets into **positive, negative, or neutral** sentiments. By fine-tuning the model with **Hugging Face Transformers**, I leveraged **transfer learning** for improved accuracy in sentiment classification.

#### Analyzing Food and Drug Adverse Event Reports
This project analyzes the **CAERS** dataset to identify patterns in food and drug-related adverse events. By applying **data analysis and visualization techniques**, I explored trends and insights that could help in understanding the risks associated with different food products.The analysis is made interactive with **Streamlit**, allowing users to explore trends dynamically.
