### My Data Science, Machine Learning, and NLP projects

#### Sentiment Analysis on Tweets
Sentiment analysis helps analyze the emotions behind tweets and other text data. This project uses **XLM-RoBERTa**, a multilingual transformer model, to classify tweets into **positive, negative, or neutral** sentiments. By fine-tuning the model with **Hugging Face Transformers**, I leveraged **transfer learning** for improved accuracy in sentiment classification.

#### Analyzing Food and Drug Adverse Event Reports
This project analyzes the **CAERS** dataset to identify patterns in food and drug-related adverse events. By applying **data analysis and visualization techniques**, I explored trends and insights that could help in understanding the risks associated with different food products.The analysis is made interactive with **Streamlit**, allowing users to explore trends dynamically.

### Predicting Gestational Diabetes Risk  
Gestational diabetes can have significant health implications for both the mother and baby. In this project, I developed three **machine learning models** that predicts gestational diabetes risk based on various clinical and demographic factors. The model aims to assist healthcare professionals in early detection and intervention. Moreover, a simple **interactive UI** was built using `ipywidgets` in Google Colab, allowing users to input feature values and obtain predictions from the trained models.

### Predicting Critical Temperature in Superconductors   
This project focuses on predicting the **critical temperature** of superconducting materials using **regression models** built with **two different libraries: SparkMLlib and Scikit-Learn**. By analyzing material compositions and properties, the model provides insights into superconducting behavior.

### Predicting Abalone Age Using Machine Learning  
This project aims to predict the **age of abalones** based on physical attributes such as shell size and weight. Using **machine learning regression models**, I implemented **Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest** to estimate abalone age. The model is deployed as a web application for easy access and use.

### Traffic Bottleneck Identification on Road Networks  
This was my **Final Year Project (FYP)**, where I led a team to develop a **traffic bottleneck identification system**. The project focused on optimizing road networks by detecting congestion points and suggesting **efficient alternative routes**.
